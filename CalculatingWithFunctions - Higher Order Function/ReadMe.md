Today, 10/09/2022, I am for sure a Newbie, in this Python world, but this does not stop me to wonder and to apriciate the powers behind this language.

I have to admit that the solution for this CodeWar problem blew my mind, and I will post it here in order to show it to others.

Requirements:

This time we want to write calculations using functions and get the results. Let's have a look at some examples:

seven(times(five())) # must return 35

four(plus(nine())) # must return 13

eight(minus(three())) # must return 5

six(divided_by(two())) # must return 3
